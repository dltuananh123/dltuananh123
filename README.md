### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1643514389/3643/cool-doge.gif?1643514389" width="25"/>

I’m [**pr3da**](), a software engineering student and junior frontend dev in Vietnam. I like exploring technologies, building something from scratch and keeping things simple.

**These days I’m focused on:**
- Self learning to improve core knowledge
- UI components with subtle motion
- Small, thoughtful projects with polish
